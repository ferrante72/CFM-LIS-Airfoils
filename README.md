# CFM-LIS-Airfoils
Law of Incipient Separation for Incompressible Turbulent Flows over Airfoils
## Description
The python code uses user input of airfoil and angle of attack to determine flow separation using the law of incipient separation 
## Getting Started
### Dependencies
* Initial code compiled with spyder environment (If other environments are used, may result in code error)
### Installing

* LIS_Airfoils code is available in the current file as law_of_incipient_separation_airfoils.py.

### Executing program

* User input NACA 4-digit number
* User input angle of attack
* User input Reynold number
* Code output whether flow separates over airfoil
